Goals

1.  Design of new fashion products using U-Net and DDPM with the MNIST Fashion dataset.
2.  Fine-tune the generative output to have a better quality of visual.

3. Conduct depth mapping and 3D rendering with Open3D that should lead to creating a 3D model.

4.  An efficient pipeline, streamlined from 2D generative designs to 3D visualizations.

	Introduction 

Generative AI represents a framework within computational design, whereas machines learns patterns from data to generate innovative and realistic outputs. Its applications in various fields, including fashion, gaming, architecture, and product design. A prominent use for generative models, famous for its structured yet diverse nature, is the MNIST Fashion dataset, contains of grayscale images of clothing items.
Using such models as U-Net and DDPM, designers and creators from various fields then will be able to deliver forward-thinking designs ahead of time.
